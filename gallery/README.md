# Google Exercise - Photo Gallery
**URL**: http://johnnyl.in/gallery/?pw=google

## Notes
* I decided to go with React and Redux, to keep the project maintainable and extensible. Future features can be easily added through explicit actions and new components.
* In the detail view, the user can swipe left and right to navigate through the photos.
* There is also functionality for +1, comments, adding to a collection, and sharing.
* For the grid thumbnails, I decided to use background-image so that I could ensure the same aspect ratio for each image in the grid. In the detail view, I just show the original image size.
